//  main.cpp
//  Reservation system
//  CIS-55 C/C++ Programming

//  Inputs: The program starts and prompts the user to input an int for the number of rows and an int for the number of seats on each row. Once the array of seats is displayed, the program will prompt the user to select a seat to claim. After each seat selection the program will indicate it is now taken as well as ask the user if they want to select another seat.

//  Outputs: Depending on what the user selects for the amount of rows and seats, the program will output an array of seats. And if the user elects to claim more than seat, the program will continue to track and display the available seats in array format and in senetence format until there are none available left.
