//  Inputs: There are two players. Each player takes turns inputting a number 1-9 when it's their turn. The inputted number must be valid and not alrady used.
//  Outputs: After accepting the inputs and running the CheckForWinningGame function, the game out the result of the game. The game is either won by either player, or all the squares have been filled (Cat's Game).
