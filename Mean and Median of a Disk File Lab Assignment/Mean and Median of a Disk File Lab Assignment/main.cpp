//  Mean and Median of a Disk File Lab Assignment

//  Inputs: When the program starts, the user is prompted to enter the name of the data file that they would like to run. Pleaase provide file path (i.e /Users/RyanMunguia/Desktop/Balances-1.txt

//  Output: The program will analyze your file and output both the mean and median of the your provided numbers.
